We are going to do agent handover i.e. I am on new chat session.
Ensure you are familiar with cursor rules. 
Read overallcontext.md if you want to see the entire scope in short way.
Read implemnted.md to see what is already implemented.  
Read scope.md only IF you want to read entire scope for better context. 
Read mistakes.md to avoid mistakes in future. 
If you can, you can take context from other chat session as well.
