So in this chat session, I told you issues and you solved it after multiple chatting. 
I want you to log this to mistakes.md file. 
It should be best for other agents so that they dont repeat this mistake again. It is sort of lesson learned. 
Structure it effectively like Issue, cause, solution and lesson.

Important note: ALWAYS Log after the end of file. I see previouisly, agent appeneded it in between the file.
