We are going to implement new feature. 
Ensure you are familiar with cursor rules. 
Read overallcontext.md if you want to see the entire scope in short way.
Read implemnted.md to see what is already implemented.  
Read scope.md only IF you want to read entire scope for better context. 
Read mistakes.md to avoid mistakes in future. 
Remember we have centralized styling system so whenver building any frontend, do styling from there. (read frontend.mdc rule file for further context)
