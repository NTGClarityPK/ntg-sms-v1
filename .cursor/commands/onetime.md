Every endpoint is now isolated. 
Previously it was under dashboard. 

For example 

students screen was dashboard/students but after fix it is just /students 
similary for attendance and settings screens. 

But I see reports endpoint still using /dashboard/reports system. 

Fix this and make report independent like others. /reports
