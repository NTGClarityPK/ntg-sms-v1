We are going to get updated what we have done so far so we can continue with this chat. 
The goal is you know what is covered. 

Read overallcontext.md if you want to see the entire scope in short way.
Read implemnted.md to see what is already implemented.  
Read scope.md only IF you want to read entire scope for better context. 
If you can, you can take context from other chat session as well.
