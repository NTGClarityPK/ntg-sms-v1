# School Management System - Global Rules

## Tech Stack (Non-Negotiable)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Styling**: Mantine UI v7+ ONLY (NO Tailwind, NO vanilla CSS, NO inline styles for static values)
- **Theme System**: Centralized theme system - ALL colors, fonts, and spacing MUST come from `themeConfig.ts` (see frontend.mdc for detailed rules)
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth
- **Data Fetching**: React Query (TanStack Query)
- **Validation**: Zod (frontend), class-validator (backend)

## Architecture Rules
- Frontend calls NestJS backend API, NEVER Supabase directly (except auth)
- All API responses follow format: `{ data, meta, error }`
- Use TypeScript strict mode - no `any` types allowed
- One component per file, co-locate related files
- Feature-based folder organization in both frontend and backend

## Before Implementing ANY Feature
1. Read `@overallcontext.md` for project scope and completed features
2. Check `@contracts.md` for API specifications
3. Review `@mistakes.md` for patterns to avoid
4. Look for similar existing implementations to follow patterns

## Supabase MCP Connection
* Remember you are always connected via MCP with Supabase
* Via this MCP, do all the table and schema creation through cursor unless specifed otherwise

## Code Quality Standards
- Meaningful variable/function names
- JSDoc comments for public functions
- Handle all error states explicitly
- No console.log in production code (use proper logging)
- No hardcoded values - use environment variables or constants
- Build less than 200 lines at a time
- any function should NOT be that much lengthy which is difficult to review later
- When writing English copy (labels, messages, docs), use **British English** (e.g. “colour”, “organisation”, “programme”) instead of US spellings

## What NOT To Do
- Do NOT add features not explicitly requested
- Do NOT remove existing functionality without asking
- Do NOT modify files not mentioned in the task
- Do NOT use deprecated APIs - always use current versions - see current system date
- Do NOT skip error handling
- Do NOT use Tailwind classes anywhere
- Do NOT hardcode colors, fonts, or font sizes - ALWAYS use centralized theme system
- Do NOT create custom CSS files for component styling - use theme config instead

* BEFORE BUILDING ANY FRONTEND COMPONENT, REFER TO UI_UX_Design.md file in project root so out buttons and tables are design re das per the file instructions.

## Response Style
- Provide concise, direct answers
- Avoid verbose code - prefer clean and readable
- When unsure, ask for clarification instead of guessing
